Test with terrain stl files
===========================

Currently (2015-08-18) it contains two ``.stl`` files for 3d printing of landscapes.

I've created the two files with http://jthatch.com/terrain2stl/, they're
created with public elevation data.

License? Public domain. I've just generated them with a free-to-use website.

(Note: I've mostly put them on github as there's an integrated ``.stl`` viewer
on github.com :-) )
